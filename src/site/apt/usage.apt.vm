Usage

  ${project.name} generates Java, C++ or Python sources from <<<.proto>>> files using the <<<protoc>>> tool.
  The following examples describe the basic usage of the Plugin.

* Compiling Protobuf Sources into Java

  The following default directory structure of the project is assumed:

+-----+

./
+- pom.xml
+- src/
   +- main/
      +- proto/
         +- message.proto
   +- test/
      +- proto/
         +- test_message.proto

+-----+

  Protocol buffer definitions are looked up under <<<src/main/proto/>>> directory by default.
  Any subdirectories under <<<src/main/proto/>>> are treated as package structure for protobuf definition imports.
  Similarly, protobuf definitions for use in tests are looked up under <<<src/test/proto/>>> directory
  by default.

  A minimal configuration to invoke this plugin would look like:

+-----+

<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.8.0</version>
        <configuration>
          <source>1.8</source>
          <target>1.8</target>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <protocExecutable>/usr/local/bin/protoc</protocExecutable>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>compile</goal>
              <goal>test-compile</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.protobuf</groupId>
      <artifactId>protobuf-java</artifactId>
      <version>3.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
  </dependencies>
  ...
</project>

+-----+

  The following conditions need to be met:

  * Java 1.8 or newer is required for running Maven

  * Java 1.8 or newer is required for compiling the generated sources

  * Either <<<protoc>>> executable has to be in the <<<PATH>>> or
    the <<<protocExecutable>>> parameter has to be set to the correct location.
    An alternative configuration involves toolchains (described in plugin examples).

  * Plugin executions need to be defined, because the plugin is not part of the default lifecycle.
    However, plugin goals have default bindings to appropriate phases, therefore there is typically
    no need to specify phase bindings in plugin configuration.\
    Note: <<<{{{./test-compile-mojo.html}test-compile}}>>> goal will only be needed if there are custom protocol
    buffer definitions being used in your tests.

  * An appropriate version of <<<com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java>>> dependency has to be declared,
    or made available through POM inheritance: this is needed for compiling the generated source code.
    Note: it is important to make sure that the version of protobuf compiler is compatible
    with the version of protobuf java library (ideally they should be of the same version),
    otherwise the generated code will fail to compile.

  []

  As soon as everything is set up, execute the following goals to build the project:

+-----+

mvn clean install

+-----+

* Dealing with "Command line is too long" errors

  This plugin simply invokes <<<protoc>>> binary, passing all necessary arguments on the command line.
  In some configurations with a very large number of protobuf definitions this may be a problem,
  due to the limits on command line length in the host operating system.
  Starting with <<<protoc>>> version 3.5.0 this can be worked around by passing the following option:

+-----+

<plugin>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <configuration>
    ...
    <useArgumentFile>true</useArgumentFile>
  </configuration>
  ...
</plugin>

+-----+

  Unfortunately, for versions of <<<protoc>>> below 3.5.0, the only available option is to split
  the compilation into smaller chunks by decomposing the project into modules.

* Compiling Protobuf Sources into other programming languages

  The plugin configuration is similar to compiling into Java, with the following alterations:

  * A different set of goals will need to be used (e.g. {{{./compile-cpp-mojo.html}compile-cpp}});

  * A dependency on <<<com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java>>> artifact may not be required.

  []

* Running Plugin Goals On Command Line

  It is possible to run ${project.name} goals from the command line,
  even if the plugin is not configured in the project:

+-----+

mvn ${goalPrefix}:compile      -DprotocExecutable="C:/Java/protobuf-2.4.1/bin/protoc.exe"
mvn ${goalPrefix}:test-compile -DprotocExecutable="C:/Java/protobuf-2.4.1/bin/protoc.exe"

+-----+

  If a <<<protobuf>>> toolchain is configured in the project,
  then the toolchains plugin needs to be executed first
  and there is no need to specify the <<<protocExecutable>>> parameter.

+-----+

mvn toolchains:toolchain ${goalPrefix}:compile
mvn toolchains:toolchain ${goalPrefix}:test-compile

+-----+

* Suppressing Compilation Of Unchanged Definitions

  Normally this plugin invokes <<<protoc>>> compilation on every execution,
  but this can be overridden by the following configuration option:

+-----+

<plugin>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <configuration>
    ...
    <checkStaleness>true</checkStaleness>
  </configuration>
  ...
</plugin>

+-----+

  If the project is built on NFS, the following setting may also be needed:

+-----+

<plugin>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <configuration>
    ...
    <checkStaleness>true</checkStaleness>
    <staleMillis>10000</staleMillis>
  </configuration>
  ...
</plugin>

+-----+

* Output Of Binary File Descriptor Sets

  It is possible to output binary <<<FileDescriptorSet>>> files containing all the descriptor
  metadata for generated classes. Descriptor sets are written by passing the <<<--descriptor_set_out>>>
  and <<<--include_imports>>> arguments to <<<protoc>>>.

  Generated descriptor sets can optionally be attached to the build as artifacts.
  The default type and extension for descriptor sets is <<<pb>>>, and the plugin extensions need
  to be enabled in order to support the correct resolution of those dependencies in downstream projects.

  Please see documentation for the following goals:
  {{{./compile-descriptor-set-mojo.html}compile-descriptor-set}} and
  {{{./test-compile-descriptor-set-mojo.html}test-compile-descriptor-set}}.
